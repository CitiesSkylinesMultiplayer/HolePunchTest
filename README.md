# HolePunchTest
Testing Client + Server + Relay for hole punching (.NET Core)

The GS server will eventually move to the main CSM repo `/src/gs`

## Usage

1. Start the GS on a server where the required port is open to the public (and a static IP)
2. Start the client on two different computers.
3. One PC should be client, the other server.
4. Follow the instructions and connect to each other. You shouldnt need to port forward your PCs.
